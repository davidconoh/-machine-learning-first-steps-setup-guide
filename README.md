# Machine Learning First Steps Setup Guide
This setup guide is for the **tutorial** at [Yonder Hacks](https://github.com/yonderhacks/machine-learning-first-steps).

## Getting Started
Before we kick start our learning journey, we would require you own a laptop running a recent version of any of the popular operating systems ([Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), [Mac](https://www.apple.com/mac/), [Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/)), or [**Raspberry Pi**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) computer, an active **Internet** connection, and the following services to get you ready for an amazing experience:

- **Anaconda software**
- **GitHub account**
- **Git**
- **Python 3 libraries**
- **Extensions**

### - **Anaconda Software**
**Anaconda** is a powerful tool for data science and exploration enjoyed by an extensive community of developers and data scientists from across the world. It is supported on **Windows**, **Mac**, **Linux**, and **the Pi** with some caveats you will find out in this lesson. To get **Anaconda** up and running on your machine, head over to the Individual Open Source Edition [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) to download the latst version for your platform before getting started.

There is great support for [Windows](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/), [Mac](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/), [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/), and [the Pi](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39371772/how-to-install-anaconda-on-raspberry-pi-3-model-b) to get it to work on your system if you need help. 

### - **GitHub account**
**GitHub** has been an amazing support for open projects on the web and we are going to take advantage of it to create our portfolio. Head over to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and **Sign up** for a free account or **Sign in** to your existing account if you already have one.

Don't be lazy now, you'll be glad you did after this lesson.

### - **Git**
Without **Git**, it is impossible to use **GitHub**. We will use this tool to manage the different versions and stages of developing our machine learning model.

Installing **Git** on **Windows** can be tricky, but we recommend [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and this [guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/install-git-git-bash-windows/) provides wonderful setup instructions.

 **Git** preinstalled on most versions of **macOS** and **Linux**. However, if you are unable to find **Git** on your machine by typing
```
git --version
```
on your terminal, head over to [git-scm.com/download/linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) to get the latest version for your **Linux** flavor or [git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) for **macOS**.

**Git** is installed on **Raspberry Pi** by default.

For first time setup, follow this [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).

### - **Python 3 libraries**

### - **Extensions**
